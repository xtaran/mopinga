About
-----

`nopinga` is a small wrapper around `noping`, the NCurses frontend to
[liboping](https://github.com/octo/liboping) to allow one to ping all
addresses a hostname given on the commandline potentially resolves to.

This helps to ping both, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of dual-stack hosts
as well as pinging all IP addresses of loadbalancer systems.

It is essentially an implementation of [liboping feature request
(issue) #52: Please add a (n)oping option to ping all IP addresses
(i.e. both, IPv4 and IPv6) for given
hostnames](https://github.com/octo/liboping/issues/52), so far only
for `noping`, but it should be easy to add support for `oping`, too.

All options and parameter to options are passed to `noping` unmodified
â€” with the exception of unssupported options, namely `-4` and `-6`
(which make not much sense in this case) as well as `-f` (not yet
implemented).

Option accumulation is currently not supported either.


Dependencies
------------

`noping` is written in [Perl](https://www.perl.org/) and requires at
least Perl 5.10. Additionally it requires these Perl modules:

* `Net::DNS`
* `Regexp::Common`
* `List::Util` (part of Perl's core as of this writing)

### Development and Debugging

`nopinga` uses `Smart::Comment`-style comments as debugging
statements. I use them like this:

```
$ perl -MSmart::Comments ./nopinga www.example.org

### DEBUG: '2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946',
###        '93.184.216.34'
```
