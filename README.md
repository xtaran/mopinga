=======

About
-----

`nopinga` is a small wrapper around `noping`, the NCurses frontend to
[liboping](https://github.com/octo/liboping) to allow to ping all
addresses a hostname given on the commandline potentially resolves to.

This helps to ping both, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of dual-stack hosts
as well as pinging all IP addresses of loadbalancer systems.

It is essentially an implementation of [liboping issue
#52: Please add a (n)oping option to ping all IP addresses (i.e. both,
IPv4 and IPv6) for given
hostnames](https://github.com/octo/liboping/issues/52), so far only
for `noping`, but it should be easy to add support for `oping`, too.

All options and parameter to options are passed to `noping` unmodified
â€” with the exception of unssupported options, namely `-4` and `-6`
(which make not much sense in this case) as well as `-f` (not yet
implemented.

Option accumulation is currently not supported either.
